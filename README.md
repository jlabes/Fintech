Below are the JDK version, IDE and build tool to deploy this project locally:
JDK 17
Maven 3.9.6
STS 4

After the setup type mvn spring-boot:run in your git bash or terminal to start the embedded-tomcat.
Open a client of your preference (in my case I used firefox) and past this URL: http://localhost:8080/553774
That's all!
